# The project
This project is a simple booking script used to book the current appointment for the *AU bupa Health Examination*. The script is written in node.js and puppeteer. **To use the script, you need to book a health examination appointment manually first while the location is not limited**. Then you can use the script to book the any other appointment at any location.

There are two main files in the project:

## 1. package.json
List the dependencies of the project
## 2. book_health_test.js
Below is the requirement of the script:
1. Require personal information(email address, first name, surname, DOB)
2. Postcode
3. Location number(which is the number of the location you want to book the appointment)
4. Date you want to book the appointment.

**Suggestion**: 
First, set the breakpoint and run the script in debug mode to see the browser actions. Then you can run the script in normal mode.
